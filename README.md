## The challenge

The challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) was to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

Moreover, users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode 

## Design

The web was made full responsive, with a design for each screen.
